<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Air Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired</li><li>Indirect Fired</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fired air heater market is divided into two primary types: direct fired and indirect fired heaters. Direct fired heaters operate by burning fuel directly in the air stream, providing efficient and immediate heat transfer, making them ideal for applications requiring quick temperature responses. In contrast, indirect fired heaters separate the combustion process from the air stream, using a heat exchanger to transfer warmth. This method minimizes contamination risks and allows for more precise temperature control, suitable for sensitive environments.</p></p>
